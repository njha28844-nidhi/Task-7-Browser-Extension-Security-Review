Task 7: Browser Extension Security Review
Overview

In this task, I reviewed all installed browser extensions to identify and remove any suspicious or unnecessary ones. After a detailed inspection, no malicious or unnecessary extensions were found, so no removals were required.

All installed extensions were verified as safe based on their permissions, reviews, and sources.

Steps Performed

Opened the browser’s extension/add-ons manager.

Reviewed all installed extensions carefully.

Checked permissions and user reviews for each extension from the official store.

Identified unused or suspicious extensions.

Since no suspicious or unnecessary extensions were found, no removals were required.

Restarted the browser and checked for any performance issues.

Researched how malicious browser extensions can harm users.

Documented the entire process and findings.

Findings

✅ All installed extensions are from official sources (Chrome Web Store / Firefox Add-ons).

✅ Permissions requested by extensions are relevant to their functionality.

✅ Reviews and ratings from the store indicate that all extensions are safe to use.

✅ No extension showed signs of suspicious or malicious behavior.

❌ No extension was removed because none were unsafe or unnecessary.

Research: How Malicious Extensions Can Harm Users

Malicious browser extensions can pose serious risks, such as:

Stealing sensitive information like passwords and cookies

Injecting unwanted ads or redirecting websites

Tracking browsing activity (privacy invasion)

Modifying browser settings without user consent

Downloading additional malware in the background

This is why regular auditing of browser extensions is important to maintain security.

Proof of Work (PoC)

Screenshots of the extension review process and extension list have been attached in this repository as proof of completion.

Final Conclusion

After a complete review, all current browser extensions were found to be secure and necessary for usage. No action was needed for removal.

Regular audits like this help maintain a clean and safe browsing environment.
